# Data Set:  
The Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset provides comprehensive information about various titles available on the popular streaming platform. The dataset includes details such as the title's name, its type (whether it is a TV show or a movie), a brief description of the content, the year it was released, age certification rating, runtime (for TV shows: length of episodes; for movies: duration), IMDb score, and IMDb votes.

By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the distribution of IMDb scores and ratings for both TV shows and movies available on Netflix. This information can help us understand the popularity and reception of titles based on user ratings.

The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure accuracy and relevance. It excludes any null values in IMDb scores to maintain data integrity. Each entry also contains an ID that corresponds to JustWatch (a platform for legal streaming) as well as the respective title ID on IMDb.

To visualize the distribution of IMDb scores effectively, we will be using histograms. Histograms categorize data into bins or intervals based on a chosen metric (in this case: IMDb score). The length of each bar within a bin represents the number of titles falling within that particular range of scores. With correct binning techniques, we can observe patterns and trends in how different shows and movies are rated by viewers.
